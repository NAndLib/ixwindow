<p align="center">
  <img src="example.gif" alt="animated" />
</p>

## Installation

Just modify `install.sh` script for your case and run it. Things to specify:
- background color of polybar bar
- size of icon
- coordinates for icon
- path to `ixwindow` folder (default: `$HOME/.config/polybar/scripts/ixwindow`)

You will also need to add this to your polybar `config` file:

```
[module/ixwindow]
type = custom/script
exec = /path/to/ixwindow
tail = true
```



## Known issues & limitations

- Unable to kill the previous ixwindow, without addining it to path
- Add png support, but it will require compositor as well
- Untested on multi monitors system
